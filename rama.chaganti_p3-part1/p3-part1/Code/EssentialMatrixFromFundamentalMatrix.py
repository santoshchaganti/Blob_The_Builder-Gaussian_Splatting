    EssentialMatrixFromFundamentalMatrix: Computes the Essential Matrix (E) from the Fundamental Matrix (F)
    and the camera intrinsic matrix (K).
    
    Parameters:
    - F: Fundamental matrix (3x3), relating corresponding points between two views in normalized image coordinates.
    - K: Intrinsic camera matrix (3x3), containing the intrinsic parameters of the camera.
    
    Returns:
    - new_E: Corrected Essential matrix (3x3) that enforces the constraints necessary for a valid Essential matrix.

    # Transpose of the intrinsic matrix K

    # Compute the initial Essential matrix E using E = K^T * F * K

    # Apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to E to enforce constraints for a valid Essential matrix
    
    # Essential matrix constraint: Enforce two singular values to be 1 and the third to be 0
    # This is because an Essential matrix has a rank of 2 and two equal non-zero singular values.
    
    # Reconstruct the corrected Essential matrix by applying the modified singular values
