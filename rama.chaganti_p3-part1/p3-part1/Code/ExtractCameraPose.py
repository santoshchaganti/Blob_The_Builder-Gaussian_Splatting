# Function to ensure the rotation matrix R has a positive determinant

    """
    CheckDet: Adjusts the rotation matrix R and translation vector C if the determinant of R is negative.
    This is done to ensure that R represents a valid rotation matrix with a determinant of +1.
    
    Parameters:
    - R: Rotation matrix (3x3).
    - C: Translation vector (3x1).
    
    Returns:
    - Adjusted R and C such that det(R) >= 0.
