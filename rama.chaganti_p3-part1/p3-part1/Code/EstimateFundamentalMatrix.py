    # Step 1: Normalization - Improves numerical stability by normalizing points to a common scale
        # Compute centroids of the points in each image
        # Shift points to have zero mean (centering) by subtracting the centroid
        # Compute scaling factors to make the mean distance of points from the origin equal to sqrt(2)
        # Construct the normalization transformation matrices for both images

    # Step 2: Construct the Linear System (A) for Estimating F
        # Set up a linear system A*f = 0, where f is the vector form of the matrix F
        # Initialize the first row of matrix A using the first pair of points
        # Normalize the source point using the transformation matrix

        # Construct the first row of A using the epipolar constraint x2^T * F * x1 = 0
        # Repeat for all other points to build the full matrix A
        
    # Step 3: Solve the Linear System Using SVD
    # Find the solution to A*f = 0 by taking the SVD of A and using the right singular vector corresponding to the smallest singular value
    # Hint: u, s, vh = LA.svd(A)
    # F is the last column of V (smallest singular value)
    # Reshape F into a 3x3 matrix

    # Step 4: Enforce Rank-2 Constraint on F
    # The Fundamental matrix must be rank-2, so we set the smallest singular value of F to zero
    # Set the smallest singular value to zero
    # Reconstruct F with rank-2 constraint

    # Step 5: Scaling - Ensure the last element of F is 1 for consistency

    # Step 6: Denormalize the Fundamental Matrix
    # Transform F back to the original coordinate system using the inverse of the normalization transformations

    return F  # Return the estimated Fundamental matrix
